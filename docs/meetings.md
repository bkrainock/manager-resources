# Meetings

My general philosophy is that as an EM, I'm in plenty of meetings so you don't have to be. With that said, not all meetings are bad, and in many cases a productive meeting can enable the ability to move forward faster than other modalities. I value your time as well as my own which is why I strive to only schedule meetings I feel provide value, I'm more than happy to end meetings early if our objectives are accomplished in less time than anticipated, and I'm happy to cancel meetings if their objective becomes obsolete. I also believe stretches of "heads down time" is important for developers which is why I try and schedule meetings in the mornings or the afternoons (based on a team's needs and cadence). If you need my help with something now, please don't hesitate to throw some time on my calendar!

## 1:1s

1:1s are our time to focus on what's going on with you. This includes **working together** on _your career_. Other items I enjoy using the time for is to hear what's going well for you personally, what is challenges are you facing and any other items you want to share with me or discuss together.

I will use these 1:1s to give you feedback, unblock you, work on your goals, and help you with anything that you need help with. I may take notes when it makes sense, but notes will not be taken for conversations we have in discretion. Creating safe environments is of the utmost importance to me, and things you tell me in confidence will stay that way unless I have your permission to share.

We can work together to set a meeting cadence that works for us. Both of us have the ability to reschedule our 1:1 if the time doesn't work out.

## Stand Up

Our standup is for fifteen minutes, and the cadence will be determined by what is best for the team. I will typically welcome everyone and kick things off and I have found popcorn rotation as an effective method for each member to share the following:

- Any blockers
- What we worked on since the last standup
- What we're currently working on

Things I am generally listening for in stand up:

- Check if anyone is blocked for an unreasonable amount of time
- Am I needed to escalate issues or help someone get unblocked?
- Keep a general temperature check on things if people are stressed
- Are we missing connections I can facilitate to help progress?

All members of the team are expected to attend/participate.

## Engineer Team Sync

I have found its helpful to have a standing meeting on calendars weekly for the purpose of doing the work that can slip through the cracks if we as a team aren't intentional. Some weeks we may only need a fraction of the time, or not need the meeting at all. I'm glad to adjust accordingly if our time is better spent elsewhere.

 In the engineering team sync, some of the things I like to focus on (the agenda is always open to additional needs of the team) are:

- Any news I may have with the team
- Brainstorming different solutions/architectures/system design etc.
- Knowledge Sharing
- Tech showcase with the team

## Retrospectives

At the end of each month all members of the team (and sometimes guests when it makes sense) will attend a 1 hour retrospective where we go over:

- What worked
- What could have been improved
- Action items for next time


All members of the team are expected to attend the synchronous retrospective.

## Hot Bev Chats

Twice a month we have informal hot beverage (not everyone is a coffee drinker) chats for half an hour. It's completely optional for team members to attend, but highly encouraged so we can relax and get to know one another!

## Slack

Slack should be used to coordinate development efforts. It is also a place to provide a bit of a virtual water cooler and connect more with each other. Also emoji. :palm_tree: :sunglasses: :v:

We have a public channel for work talk and a private channel for more sensitive topics.
