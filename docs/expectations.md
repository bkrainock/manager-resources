## My Expectations

**I expect you, dear reader, to give me your best effort each day.** I understand some days are just not working out. That's totes fine. I want to work with you to make sure that you have a reasonable workload with reasonable deadlines and you are taking care of yourself. If you aren't able to give it your all for whatever reason, let's talk about it sooner rather than later, remember I can't help or support you if I'm unaware!

**I expect you to show up on time and be present at meetings.** Things happen and we run late to meetings from time to time, this is understandable, but my expectation is this is an exception and not the rule. I value your time and will do my best to make sure our meetings are productive. I am not a fan of filling the time scheduled for a meeting just because. If we finish early my goal is to get you all back to more important items. Given the remote nature of work these days its safe to assume all meetings will be remote friendly so they're accessible to everyone. So put on some cozy-town pants and and be fully present for the short time we have together. More thoughts on meetings [here](meetings.md)

**I expect you to let me know as soon as possible when things aren't going as planned and projects are at risk.** I know delivering bad news is hard and never fun...I don't enjoy it either. But it is imperative we identify risks as soon as possible so we can identify ways to swarm and mitigate those risks. Please keep in mind that bad news ages poorly.

**I expect you to help out your fellow teammates if they need help.** We all have trouble here and there and no one likes to feel like a burden! Remember it requires vulnerability to ask for help! If someone is asking for help then let's help teach one another the skills we need to solve the problem. It is not ok to make someone feel guilty for needing help. Remember we all need a hand or second set of eyes at one point in time or another.

**I expect you to be respectful of one another's lived experiences.** I hate to use a buzzword, but diversity & inclusion is super important to making good teams. That means sometimes misunderstandings happen! But I expect you to be respectful of someone's lived experiences. However, keep in mind that I value the safety of the marginalized over the hurt feelings of those with more privilege. Power dynamics in terms of race, gender and gender expression, sexual identity or expression, class, disability, religion, age, body size, etc will always be kept in mind. **Clarifying questions: good. Dismissing someone's lived experiences: bad.**

## High performers

I've had the pleasure of working with several high performers in my time in leadership. Here are some general principles I try to follow when it comes to working with high performers:

- I strive to give high performers a lot of autonomy. You're talented at what you do, micromanaging will only be counterproductive. I do, however, need to be kept in the loop.

- I will do my best to guide you to new challenges. This may not always be technical challenges though. I am a fan of pair programming and believe it offers a lot of benefits for teams, including but not limited to mentoring opportunities for high performers.

- I will try very hard not to spring any last minute or unreasonable requests on you. It's pretty rude to constantly have to fight fires and it's bad for people's mental health to do so. If this does happen, I will do my best to discuss the context behind the request with you.

- I'll try to request things rather than tell you to do them. On the rare occasion I _require_ you to do something, I'll do my best to explain why it's important, the timeline it's needed, and who the request is coming from.

- I try acknowledge the good as well as the Needs Improvement(tm)! Sometimes as a high performer, you don't realize just how great you're doing because it's easy to move on to the next thing that needs fixing. I'll be sure to point out when you're also kicking ass.

- I will do my best to keep an eye on what's on your plate. Sometimes high performers end up becoming siloes. I try to break down knowledge siloes whenever possible so if I ask that we delegate a task to someone else on the team, even though you can do it much faster, its typically because I'm trying to spread the expertise across the team and take things off your plate.

## How I will provide feedback to you

I believe feedback should be given swiftly, clearly, and kindly. There's a moment in season 1 of Ted Lasso where Ted asks Nate, "Nate, are you the type of guy that likes it when someone tells you you've got something in your teeth?", then uses the opportunity to provide Nate feedback on the fit of his suit. I feel the same about providing feedback: I believe you should always tell someone if they they're doing well or there's room for improvement. 

I like to give feedback on a regular basis and I strive to provide it as closely to the action as I can and will typically consist of: 

- Any specific examples I see of behavior I'd like to see **more** of 
- Any specific examples I see of behavior I'd like to see **less** of 

Feedback will be on both technical and interpersonal parts of the job!

### Positive feedback can be conveyed in the following ways: 
I recognize everyone has varying degrees of comfort/discomfort with public recognition so please let me know your preferences at any time! (Also if these things change at any time, that's fine too! Just let me know.) Positive feedback may look like
- Public recognition in our team channel
- Public recognition from a senior engineering leader
- Engineering-wide recognition in an engineering channel by me (or a senior leader)
- DM
- Written down in our 1:1 records and added to performance reviews
- Gift card OR donation to your favorite charity OR physical gift, whichever you prefer 

### Constructive feedback can be conveyed in the following ways: 
- DM OR call OR in person
- Written down in our 1:1 records and added to performance reviews

While I'm not there yet, I am working on being very consistent in my constructive feedback. Key phrases of constructive feedback I am trying to implement by severity include: 
- "Minor feedback:" ... (i.e. truly minor nitpick thing I noticed)
- “I need you to…by...” (i.e. this wasn't great, please don't do it again)
- “You must do…by…” (i.e. you will likely be written up if you do this again)

We will always talk through any feedback and if you have additional context to add, then please feel free to do so. I believe performance reviews should never be a surprise. You and I should be having very regular conversations about things! If we are not, then that is indicative of larger problems and you should probably [provide feedback about me to my manager](housekeeping.md#feedback-for-me).
